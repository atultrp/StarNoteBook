                        Hey there, I'm <strong>Atul Tripathi</strong> from India.
                        My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.
                        <br />
                        I am also an <strong>open-source</strong> enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how <strong>collaboration and knowledge sharing</strong> happened through open-source.
